**IO**
- [x] Classes for writing and reading bit-streams;
- [ ] Proper strings writer and reader.

**Text preprocessing** 
- [x] Tokenization;
- [x] Stemming;
- [ ] Parametrization at build time.

**Index construction**
- [x] In-memory datasets index construction;
- [ ] Proper vocabulary and paths on disk;
- [ ] Spelling correction index;
- [ ] Disk-based partial index construction and merging;

**Queries**
- [x] Tf-idf ranked retrieval;
- [x] Window computation.
- [ ] Boolean queries;
- [ ] Parallel scoring.

**Evaluation**
- [ ] Query speed;
- [ ] Query quality; 
- [ ] Disk overhead.
